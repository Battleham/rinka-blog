    Every moment deserves your fullest attention. If you keep waiting for the
    next thing, you will have spent all your life waiting. Don't waste your

  heading: My Wedding Day
  description: >+
    The number one thing I say when asked is that in order to enjoy your wedding
    is to remember no matter the planning assume the worst ! Managing your
    expectations is the most important.

     During my wedding so many things went wrong and I enjoyed every minute of it! 

    Rain ✔️  dress stained ✔️  Vendors late ✔️ vendors forgetting things ✔️ Me
    forgetting things ✔️ things you didn’t think you’d need to rehearse and talk
    over ✔️


    But because I never expected it to be perfect I was never once upset and now
    all I have are the positive feeling and vibes of the most special day.
