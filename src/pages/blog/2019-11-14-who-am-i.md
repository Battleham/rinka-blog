**Tip One:**

**Get excited and have fun!**

It's your time to have fun and if you anything like me and anxiety rules you. You may not be enjoying it as much as you should. Espicially the planning which is a big NO NO. You have to enjoy and remember...no matter what it is you and your partner who must enjoy it! 

So pick the flowers you love or dont have any at all! Want to wear red instead do it! Just have fun and enjoy the happines you have and are bringing to your families with this beautiful engagment.

**Tip Two:** 

**Manage your expectations**

One thing I say when asked is that in order to enjoy your wedding is to remember no matter the planning assume the worst ! Managing your expectations is the most important. my wedding so many things went wrong and I enjoyed every minute of it! 

Rain ✔️  dress stained ✔️  Vendors late ✔️ vendors forgetting things ✔️ Me forgetting things ✔️ things you didn’t think you’d need to rehearse and talk over ✔️

But because I never expected it to be perfect I was never once upset and now all I have are the positive feeling and vibes of the most special day.
