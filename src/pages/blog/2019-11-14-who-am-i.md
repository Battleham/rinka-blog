During my wedding so many things went wrong and I enjoyed every minute of it! 

Rain ✔️  dress stained ✔️  Vendors late ✔️ vendors forgetting things ✔️ Me forgetting things ✔️ things you didn’t think you’d need to rehearse and talk over ✔️

But because I never expected it to be perfect I was never once upset and now all I have are the positive feeling and vibes of the most special day.
