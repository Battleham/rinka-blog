**Tip One:**

**Get excited and have fun!**

It's your time to have fun and if you are anything like me and anxiety rules you. You may not be enjoying it as much as you wouldve hoped you would. Espicially the planning. Which is a big NO NO. You have to enjoy and remember...no matter what it is you and your partner who must enjoy it! 

Get dressed up when going to vendors and make a date night out of it. Picture how you want the day to go. Practise dancing at home so that you laugh and trip over each other feet. Forget perfect and think fun and bonding.

When you discuss your plans do it over dinner or do it over drinks or anythign else you find fun. My husband and I would go to bars and did alot of our planning and idea taking during dates and vacations.

Another thing, you will never make every one happy. Espicially family I had so many opinions and feed back given and at the end of the day as long as you had fun and there was plenty of food drink and dancing ! Your golden. 

NO ONE and I mean NO ONE will remember if your flowers were real or what your party favours were.

So pick the flowers you love or dont have any at all! Want to wear red instead do it! Just have fun and enjoy the happines you have and are bringing to your families with this beautiful engagment.

**Tip Two:** 

**Manage your expectations**

One thing I say when asked is that in order to enjoy your wedding is to remember no matter the planning assume the worst ! Managing your expectations is the most important. my wedding so many things went wrong and I enjoyed every minute of it! 

Rain ✔️  dress stained ✔️  Vendors late ✔️ vendors forgetting things ✔️ Me forgetting things ✔️ things you didn’t think you’d need to rehearse and talk over ✔️

But because I never expected it to be perfect I was never once upset and now all I have are the positive feeling and vibes of the most special day.
