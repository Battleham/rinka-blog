  It's not easy to get focused. You must visualize your life the way you want
  it...but that's not enough is it? and it also takes great discipline and Im
  not here to tell you it is easy or that I've done it even... I consider myself
  to have low discipline and I want to fix it. For some it's so easy to have
  their goal and just be so passionate but discipline is the key in their life.
  No matter how sad you are to not binge to not stay in bed when you're tired
  from running around. We're all so programmed for instant gratification that we
  forget that nothing just happens. It takes time and sacrifice and dedication
  and it all depends on the sacrifices we make and to not waste another hour.

Recently I was laid off and I fell into depression. The worst part was I had the degree to be able to get a better job and I debated leaving for months before and I was let go and not because I was a bad employee or that I did anything wrong but because they wanted someone to not want more and not want growth. That hurt me more then I care to admit because I don't not take rejection well. I worked hard for them and for what ? It was appreciated or respected. I was using my time and my talent and going overbored for people who dont care. That's when I had my pity party and now I'm ready for more and this time to work and try for myself not someone who doesnt appreciate.
