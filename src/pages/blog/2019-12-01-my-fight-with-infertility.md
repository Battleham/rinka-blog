I remember being 15 years old and getting my periods once a year, twice, if I was lucky. I got sent to see a gynocologist who was a specialist in the matter. He told me due to my hormones I was not ovulating and therefore if left alone would not have children. 

That was the first time I heard this, it was a bit scary but at 15 you dont really care. I registered as a problem I'll worry about later.

I got offered to go on hormones that force you to menstrate or get put on birth control to attempt to fix things. \

Being young and sexually active I asked to be put on birth control to regulate. My periods started coming and everything was normal. I gained some weight but who doesnt? these pills suck LOL. Everything seemed fine otherwise.

Fast forward a year later I requested to be taken off. My hormones should regulated and I never was fan of taking pills so I'd have hoped to get off. The doctor agreed and I went off. Shortly (around a year) after getting off the pill, I was diagnosed with a growth that they couldn't identify in my right ovary. The doctors couldn’t know if it was cancerous or not without exploratory surgery first. 

it’s was later on it was diagnosed as a Borderline tumor of the ovary, more frequently termed "low malignant potential ovarian tumor." They are not actually considered carcinomas. Thankfully, surgery was all that was needed.

I was told they would have to perform exploratory surgery to get rid of this tumour and because of poor visibilty they did not know if I would have to remove both tubes or not. 

The discussion of never having kids came up again. I was 21 now and a little more interested. I agreed if necessary to have both tube removed. I figured life was worth more then having a child if indeed it was cancerous. I was lucky, my amazing surgeon was able to save my left ovary. I was given that hope back.

Each time was playing with my emotions. A whiplash of back and forth, your never going to have kids to you should be just fine. Unfortunately, I have been trying for two year with no luck. I am not even sure how to feel. My surgeon assured me there shouldnt be any complication with getting regnant and to consult a fertility specialist. ARE YOU F@%ing KIDDING ME? 

Every time I think im done with this damn body and the doctors...there is more. Now I'm just unsure wether to go or to just not do anything. I want a baby but I'm tired already and I havent even started yet.
